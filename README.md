# Genetic Algorithm for navigation in a T-Maze of an E-Puck robot in WeBots.

The E-Puck robot starts at the bottom of the central alley of a T-Maze. It has to reach one extremity of the lateral alleys of the T-Maze. 

There is two versions of the maze, one with a black mark on the middle of the central alley and one without. If the maze presented is with the mark, the robot must reach the right side of the T bar. If not, it must reach the left side. Both cases are handled through one genetic algorithm.
